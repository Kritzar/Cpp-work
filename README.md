# Metro cinepolis
This project simulates (on a rudimentary level) a metro management system. A metro management system eliminates the logistical nightmare that a physical ticket booking system entails, eliminating problems such as keeping track of ticket fares, reducing paper waste, reducing corruption in the department, reduces redundancies and human error. This system also contains an online ticket recharge module where users can recharge their smart cards online through the site.
The objectives of the project are as follows:
•	User login page where users can recharge tickets online.
•	Users can check route for their journey and also know about ticket fare cost.
•	Two methods of payment are available for user to pay their bill, card and cash.
•		User can also view the fair details and the route map.
•	An admin login page where admin can add stations, routes, update fairs and even add a new admin.
•	User can book tickets and see the metro map.
•	User can check their balance and also recharge their metro card
•	User can also register for a new metro card
•	Admin can change their password also
